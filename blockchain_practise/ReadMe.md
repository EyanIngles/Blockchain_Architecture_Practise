# Blockchain Concept::

## what are we doing different?
simply experimenting with different types and idea's on how blockchains can work in different ways.
let's break this down a little.

### Wallet
users are able to get a wallet, to keep things simple, we will be using an address which is in type of string, currency, amount, name so people are able to search up wallets via name instead of address, the address is what will determine whether it is the correct name or not.
